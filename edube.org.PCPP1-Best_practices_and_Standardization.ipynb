    "- mysamplename – lowercase\n",

    "- MYSAMPLENAME – uppercase\n",

    "\n",
    "When giving a name to a **method**, you should use a lowercase word or words separated by underscores, e.g., method, my_class_method. You should always use self for the first argument to instance methods, and cls for the first argument to class methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "When giving a name to a **constant**, you should use uppercase letters and separate words by underscores, e.g., TOTAL, MY_CONSTANT.\n",

    "When giving a name to a **module**, you should use a lowercase word or words, preferably short, and separate them with underscores, e.g., samples.py, my_samples..\n",

    "**Type variable** names should follow the CamelCase convention and be short, e.g., AnyStr, or Num.\n",

    "When giving a name to an **exception**, you should follow the same convention as with classes (bear in mind that exceptions should actually be classes), i.e., use the CamelCase style.\n",
